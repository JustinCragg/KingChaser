# KingChaser
For the first year major project at AIE I worked together with Artists, Designers and other Programmers to make a prototype game, according to a set brief, over a period of eight weeks. The prototype was required to be a local two-player, turn-based strategy game with a minimum of three unique units, fog of war and the objective must be to protected the 'king'.
